# Random-forest
Random forest is an **Ensemble** of tress(descision tree), not just one tree. Random Forest is one of the most popular and most powerful machine learning algorithms

because

 **It is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm**, ( Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging and boosting)=ensampling methods 
 
 AN ensemble takes individual learning models & combines them to produce an aggreagative model that is more powerful than any of its individual model
 
 ##$)As tha name suggest random forest as the forest consist of many trees random forest algorithm also bulid by combination of multiple decision trees
 
 
 # ensemble learning
 We all do that. Before we make any big decisions, we ask people’s opinions, like our friends, our family members, even our dogs/cats, to prevent us from being biased  or irrational.
The model does that too. it is very common that the individual model suffers from bias or variances and that’s why we need the ensemble learning.
**Ensemble learning, in general, is a model that makes predictions based on a number of different models**. By combining individual models, the ensemble model tends to be more flexible (less bias) and less data-sensitive  (less variance).

Two most popular ensemble methods are bagging and boosting.

**Bagging**: Training a bunch of individual models in a parallel way. Each model is trained by a random subset of the data

**Boosting**: Training a bunch of individual models in a sequential way. Each individual model learns from mistakes made by the previous model.

##$)one decision tree :prone to overfitting

Many descision tree :More stable better generalisation

The random variation during tree bulding happens in two ways 

1.The data used to bulid each tree selected randomly

2.feature chosen in each split test are also randomly selected

# create random forest model(bagging)
first we decide on how many trees to bulid .This is set using the "n_estimated" parameter both(random forest classification,random forest regression)

**each tree would bulid from different sample of the data called bootstrap sample**

Bootstrap sampling:if ure training set has N instances or samples in total ,a bootstrap sample of size N is created by just repetadely picking on of the N dataset rows at random with replacment , that allowing for the possiblity of picking the same row again at each selection

u repeat this random selection process N times.This resulting bootstrap sample has N rows just like the original training set but with possibly some rows from the original dataset missing and other occuring multiple times just due to nature of the random selection with replacment.

bulding a decision tree for a random forest ,the process is almost the same as for the standard decision tree but with one important difference

when picking the best split for a node instead of finding the best split across all possible features , a random subset of features is chosen and the best split is found within the smaller subset of features

The n.o of features in the subset that are randomly  considered at each stage is controlled by the **max_feature** parameter 

this randomess in selecting the bootstrap sample to train in a forest ensemble ,combined with the fact that splitting a node in the tree is restricted to random subsets of the features of the split,virtually guarantess that all of the decision trees and the random forest will be different 

forest model is sensitive to max_features if it is one ,the model is limited to performing a split on the single feature that was selected randomly ,instead of being able to take the best split over several variables

trees in forest will be very different from each other and possibly will with many levels in order to produce agood fit to the data

if max_feature is close to total n.o of features that each instance has ,trees in the forest will tend to be similar and probably will require fewer lvelsto fit the data using the most informative features 

# prediction
once the random forest is trained ,it predicts the target value for new instance by the first making a prediction for every random forest .for regression tasks the overall prediction is then typically the mean of the individual tree predictions 

for **classification** the overall prediction is based on the weighted vote .Each tree give gives a probablity for each target classes label then probablities for each class are averaged across all the trees and the class with the highest probablity is the final predicted class.

# key parameters
**n_estimators**:n.o of trees to use in ensample(default:1),-should be larger for larger dataset to reduce overfitting(but use more computation)

**max_features**:has a strong effect on performance.Influence the diversity of trees in the forest. -default works well in practice ,but adjusting may lead to some further gains

**max_depth**:controls the depth of each tree (default:none split until all leaves are pure)

**n_jobs**:How many cores to use in parllel clustring training

choose a fixed settings for random_state parameter if u need reprodusable result
