# Random-forest
Random forest is an **Ensemble** of tress(descision tree), not just one tree.Random Forest is one of the most popular and most powerful machine learning algorithms

 It is a type of ensemble machine learning algorithm called Bootstrap Aggregation or bagging and boosting
 
 # ensemble learning
 We all do that. Before we make any big decisions, we ask people’s opinions, like our friends, our family members, even our dogs/cats, to prevent us from being biased  or irrational.
The model does that too. it is very common that the individual model suffers from bias or variances and that’s why we need the ensemble learning.
Ensemble learning, in general, is a model that makes predictions based on a number of different models. By combining individual models, the ensemble model tends to be more flexible (less bias) and less data-sensitive  (less variance).

Two most popular ensemble methods are bagging and boosting.

**Bagging**: Training a bunch of individual models in a parallel way. Each model is trained by a random subset of the data

**Boosting**: Training a bunch of individual models in a sequential way. Each individual model learns from mistakes made by the previous model.
